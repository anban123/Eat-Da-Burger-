# Eat-Da-Burger-

Link:

Overview: In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.

I have deployed it on Heroku as well as github.

NPM Packages: express, express-handlebars, mysql
